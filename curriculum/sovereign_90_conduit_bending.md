## Take-Up Table (Accurate per Bender Size)

| Conduit Size | Take-Up | Deduct |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| 1/2" EMT | 5" | 10" |
| 3/4" EMT | 6" | 12" |
| 1" EMT | 8" | 16" |
| 1-1/4" EMT | 11" | 22" |
| 1-1/2" EMT | 13" | 26" |
| 2" EMT | 16" | 32" |

## The Five Essential Bends

### 1. The 90° Bend (Stub-Up)
**Purpose:** Vertical rise to box or enclosure

**Yoda's Way:**
> "Mark your distance from the end. The arrow, place it there. Bend you must, until the level stands proud."

**Vader's Code:**
```
Stub Height = Desired Height - Take-Up
Mark Distance = Stub Height + Box Offset
```

**Steps:**
1. Measure desired stub height from box
2. Subtract take-up for your conduit size
3. Mark conduit at this distance
4. Align mark with bender arrow
5. Bend to 90° (use level to verify)

---

### 2. The Offset Bend
**Purpose:** Navigate around obstacles

**Yoda's Way:**
> "Two bends, equal and opposite. The obstacle's height, your guide it is."

**Vader's Code:**
```
Distance Between Marks = Offset Height × Multiplier

Multiplier Table:
  10° bends: 6.0
  22° bends: 2.6
  30° bends: 2.0
  45° bends: 1.4
  60° bends: 1.2
```

**Steps:**
1. Measure obstacle height
2. Choose bend angle (22° or 30° recommended)
3. Calculate distance between marks
4. Mark conduit for both bends
5. First bend: arrow forward
6. Second bend: arrow backward (reverse conduit)

---

### 3. The Saddle Bend (3-Point)
**Purpose:** Cross over pipes/obstacles

**Yoda's Way:**
> "Three bends, the center deepest. Around the obstacle, like the Force, you flow."

**Vader's Code:**
```
Center Bend: 45° (or 60° for tall obstacles)
Side Bends: 22° each (half of center)

Mark 1 (Center): Directly over obstacle center
Mark 2, 3 (Sides): Center ± (Obstacle Width × 2.5)
```

**Steps:**
1. Mark center of obstacle on conduit
2. Calculate side marks based on obstacle width
3. First bend: 22° at first side mark
4. Second bend: 45° at center mark (reverse direction)
5. Third bend: 22° at second side mark (reverse direction)

---

### 4. The Parallel Bend
**Purpose:** Multiple conduits running side-by-side

**Yoda's Way:**
> "Each bend, a mirror of its brother. Spacing you must maintain, or chaos will reign."

**Vader's Code:**
```
Spacing Adjustment = Conduit Spacing × tan(Bend Angle)

For 90° bends at 2" spacing:
  Adjustment ≈ 2" per conduit
```

**Steps:**
1. Bend first conduit normally
2. For each parallel conduit:
   - Add spacing adjustment to mark
   - Maintain same bend angle
3. Verify all conduits are parallel

---

### 5. The Kick Bend
**Purpose:** Small angle change at end of run

**Yoda's Way:**
> "A gentle nudge, the kick is called. Not a full bend, but a whisper of direction."

**Vader's Code:**
```
Kick Angle: Typically 10°-30°
Mark Distance: From end of conduit to bend point

Rise = Distance × tan(Kick Angle)
```

**Steps:**
1. Mark desired kick location
2. Align mark with bender star (not arrow)
3. Bend gently to desired angle
4. Verify with angle finder

## Common Mistakes (The Dark Side)

| Mistake | Consequence | Correction |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Wrong take-up measurement | Stub too short/long | Always verify bender manufacturer specs |
| Over-bending | Conduit kinks, NEC violation | Use level, bend in small increments |
| Ignoring shrinkage | Offset misaligned | Account for shrinkage in measurements |
| Too many bends | Wire pull impossible, NEC 358.26 | Max 360° between boxes |
| Wrong bender size | Conduit damaged, unsafe | Match bender to conduit size exactly |

---

## NEC Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Maximum 4 quarter bends (360° total) between pull points (NEC 358.26)
- [ ] Minimum bend radius per Table 2, Chapter 9
- [ ] No kinks, flattening, or damage to conduit
- [ ] Proper support within 3' of boxes (NEC 358.30)
- [ ] Supports every 10' thereafter

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Basic 90°
**Task:** Create a 24" stub-up on 1/2" EMT

**Solution:**
- Mark at: 24" - 5" (take-up) = 19"
- Bend to 90°, verify with level

### Exercise 2: 6" Offset
**Task:** Navigate a 6" obstacle with 30° bends

**Solution:**
- Distance between marks: 6" × 2.0 = 12"
- Bend first mark 30°, reverse, bend second 30°

### Exercise 3: 4" Saddle
**Task:** Cross over a 4" pipe

**Solution:**
- Center bend: 45°
- Side bends: 22° each
- Mark spacing: Center ± (4" × 2.5) = ±10"
